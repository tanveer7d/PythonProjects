# PersonalProjects

Hello, 
This is a collection of projects that I have done in Python for data analysis.
My first Project - Analysis of Top Hits from Spotify does EDA and finds some interesting insights in the data. The second project, dealing with IPL takes into consideration each ball bowled from its first season in 2008 to the latest one in 2022 and finds a few revelations. I have also created a function and a mini all player dataframe with their stats in this project.
